## 🏛️ Ecosystem Vision

### **"Prove ESG ≥ 80% without revealing private data. Bridge it to any chain in 1 click."**
> *Research objective: make selected ESG claims more traceable and verifiable.*

**GreenProof** is an experimental reference platform for transforming selected real-world signals into cryptographically verifiable attestations. It explores a privacy-preserving verification pipeline; it does not by itself replace compliance auditing or establish universal ESG truth:

```
Real-World Signals → Trinity Consensus → ZK Proof (Groth16) → On-Chain Certificate → Cross-Chain RWA
```

---

## 💡 Research direction

Current ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting is plagued by **Greenwashing** and **Data Privacy** concerns. GreenProof solves this by combining:

1.  **Triple Oracle Consensus**: Chainlink oracles ingest data from IoT sensors, LLM reports, and audits.
2.  **ZK Verification**: Proves threshold compliance (`Score >= 80`) without revealing raw datasets.
3.  **On-chain Certification**: Mints a "GreenProof" NFT certificate on Ethereum Sepolia.
4.  **CCIP Interoperability**: Bridges credentials across chains with a single click.

## 🛠️ Technical Verification & Due Diligence

Investors and grant providers can validate the Proof of Concept (PoC) in under 2 minutes:

| Step | Action | Evidence |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| 1 | Open **Live Dashboard** | [greenproof.vercel.app/dashboard](https://greenproof.vercel.app/dashboard) |
| 2 | Execute **Sovereign Demo** | Triggers the 2/3 Oracle Quorum (CRE-orchestrated) |
| 3 | Monitor **Consensus Event** | High-fidelity log stream available on dashboard |
| 4 | Audit **ZK-Verifier Status** | [/verify ↗](https://greenproof.vercel.app/verify) |
| 5 | Verify **On-Chain Settlement** | [NFT Contract ↗](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x3fcf2C7f9a0A966810fD7858A99FA915d5326B54) |

## 🏗️ Repository Architecture

This mission is powered by a **Dual-Layer Architecture** that decouples trust from semantics:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Root["/ (Root)"] --> P["protocol/ueap/"]
    Root --> A["apps/greenproof/"]
    Root --> I["infrastructure/"]
    
    subgraph "L1: Universal Protocol"
        P --> PC["ueap/contracts"]
        P --> PS["ueap/sdk"]
    end
    
    subgraph "L2: Reference App"
        A --> GPC["greenproof/src"]
        A --> GPE["greenproof/engines"]
    end
```

- **[UEAP Protocol Layer](./protocol/ueap)**: The generic, ZK-powered engine for verifiable evidence.
- **[GreenProof App](./apps/greenproof)**: The institutional ESG implementation.
